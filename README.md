===============================

Driv.in is an YouTube battle party in a virtual drive in. You can
create rooms to share with your friends and watch videos together
in real time. When your friends enter in the middle of the video,
they will be positioning at the point that everybody is viewing,
so everybody will be at the same video time. When the current video
ends, the next video will be played automatically.

This app is great for being a VJ for a day: create and share a
playlist of your favorite artist from YouTube. You and your friends
can also suggest new videos, throw tomatoes at the bad ones and
chat along!
